    "## Pro Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start with XGBoost**: It works well out-of-the-box for structured data\n",
    "2. **Always try ensembles**: Combining models rarely hurts\n",
    "3. **Text preprocessing matters**: Clean data = better results\n",
    "4. **Use pre-trained embeddings**: Don't train Word2Vec from scratch with small data\n",
    "5. **Fine-tune transformers**: BERT/GPT transfer learning beats training from scratch\n",
    "6. **Random search before grid**: Sample 10-20 random configs, then refine\n",
    "7. **Cross-validation always**: Never trust single train/test split\n",
    "8. **Monitor data drift**: Production data changes over time\n",
    "9. **Start simple**: Logistic Regression baseline, then add complexity\n",
    "10. **Document everything**: Model cards, API docs, decision rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Mistakes\n",
    "- ❌ Skipping text preprocessing\n",
    "- ❌ Not removing stop words for classification\n",
    "- ❌ Training Word2Vec on small datasets\n",
    "- ❌ Using BERT for generation (use GPT)\n",
    "- ❌ Grid searching huge spaces\n",
    "- ❌ Not validating production inputs\n",
    "- ❌ Ignoring class imbalance\n",
    "- ❌ Overfitting to validation set\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debug Checklist\n",
    "- ⚠️ Low accuracy → Check preprocessing, try ensemble\n",
    "- ⚠️ High variance → Add regularization, more data\n",
    "- ⚠️ High bias → More complex model, better features\n",
    "- ⚠️ Slow inference → Reduce model size, optimize code\n",
    "- ⚠️ Production accuracy drops → Data drift, retrain model"
