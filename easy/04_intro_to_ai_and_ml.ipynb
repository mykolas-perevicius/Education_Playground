    "\n",
    "**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is when computers can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of AI in Your Daily Life:\n",
    "- 📱 **Siri/Alexa**: Understanding and responding to your voice\n",
    "- 📧 **Email Spam Filters**: Detecting which emails are junk\n",
    "- 🎬 **Netflix/YouTube**: Recommending shows you might like\n",
    "- 📸 **Photo Apps**: Recognizing faces and organizing photos\n",
    "- 🗺️ **Google Maps**: Predicting traffic and best routes\n",
    "- 🎮 **Video Game Enemies**: Adapting to your playing style\n",
    "- 🛒 **Amazon**: \"Customers who bought this also bought...\"\n",
    "- 🚗 **Self-Driving Cars**: Navigating roads autonomously\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Types of AI\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Narrow AI (Weak AI)** - Most common today\n",
    "- Good at ONE specific task\n",
    "- Examples: Face recognition, playing chess, translating languages\n",
    "- Can't do anything outside its specific task\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. General AI (Strong AI)** - Future goal\n",
    "- Can do ANY intellectual task a human can\n",

    "**Machine Learning (ML)** is a type of AI where computers **learn from data** instead of being explicitly programmed with rules.\n",

    "### Traditional Programming vs Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional Programming:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Rules + Data → Computer → Answer\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example: \"If email contains 'FREE MONEY', mark as spam\"\n",

    "**Machine Learning:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Data + Answers → Computer → Rules (Model)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example: Show computer 10,000 spam emails and 10,000 real emails. Computer learns patterns automatically!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three Main Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Supervised Learning** (Learning with a teacher)\n",
    "- You provide **labeled data** (examples with correct answers)\n",
    "- AI learns the pattern, then predicts on new data\n",
    "- Example: Show AI 1000 cat photos labeled \"cat\" and 1000 dog photos labeled \"dog\". Now it can recognize new cats and dogs!\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Unsupervised Learning** (Learning without a teacher)\n",
    "- You provide **unlabeled data** (no correct answers)\n",
    "- AI finds patterns and groups similar things together\n",
    "- Example: Give AI customer shopping data. It discovers \"people who buy diapers often buy beer\" (true story!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Reinforcement Learning** (Learning through trial and error)\n",
    "- AI tries different actions and gets rewards/penalties\n",
    "- Learns which actions lead to best outcomes\n",
    "- Example: AI learning to play video games by trying moves and getting points"
