# The Missing Semester: Essential Developer Tools

Inspired by MIT's "The Missing Semester of Your CS Education" - this section covers practical tools and skills that every developer needs but are rarely taught in formal CS courses.

## Why These Tools Matter

Traditional CS education focuses on theory, algorithms, and programming languages. But real-world development requires mastery of powerful tools that make you 10x more productive:

- **Command Line**: Navigate and automate tasks faster than any GUI
- **Git**: Collaborate with others and never lose work
- **Text Editors**: Edit code at the speed of thought
- **Shell Scripting**: Automate repetitive tasks
- **Debugging**: Find and fix bugs efficiently
- **Security**: Protect your systems and data

## Course Structure

All lessons are **independent** - start anywhere based on your needs!

### 1. Shell and Command Line (`01_shell_basics.ipynb`)

## Quick Start

1. Open a terminal
2. Navigate to this directory: `cd Education_Playground/tools`
3. Start with `01_shell_basics.ipynb`
4. Run commands in your terminal alongside the notebook

---

## Shell Compatibility Note

These lessons focus on **Bash** (Bourne Again Shell), which is:
- Default on most Linux distributions
- Available on macOS
- Available on Windows via WSL, Git Bash, or Cygwin

Commands should work on any Unix-like system. Windows-specific differences will be noted.

## Pro Tips

1. **Learn by doing**: Don't just read - type every command
2. **Break things**: You learn best from mistakes (use a test directory!)
3. **Read error messages**: They're trying to help you
4. **Use man pages**: `man <command>` shows documentation
5. **Google is your friend**: Everyone looks up commands
6. **Build muscle memory**: Practice common commands daily
