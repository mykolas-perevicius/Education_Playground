    "**Real-world analogy:** Build systems are like assembly lines in a factory. Instead of manually running each step (compile, test, package), you define the process once and run it automatically every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "- Save hours of manual work every week\n",
    "- Catch bugs before they reach production\n",
    "- Consistent builds across all environments\n",
    "- Automated testing on every commit\n",
    "- Faster feedback loops\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you'll learn:**\n",
    "- Build automation with Make and modern tools\n",
    "- CI/CD concepts and best practices\n",
    "- GitHub Actions hands-on\n",
    "- GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI\n",
    "- Testing automation\n",
    "- Deployment pipelines\n",

    "**Time investment:** 90-120 minutes  \n",
