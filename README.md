# Education Playground - Interactive Programming, AI & Computing Platform

Welcome to the Education Playground! A comprehensive, self-paced learning platform covering **Python Programming**, **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Computer Science Fundamentals** for all skill levels.

## Overview

This repository contains a complete curriculum organized into three difficulty levels. Each level includes modules on:
- **Python Programming**: Core language skills
- **AI & Machine Learning**: From basics to deep learning
- **Computing Fundamentals**: How computers work and CS theory

**All lessons within each level can be completed in parallel** - choose your own path based on your interests!

## Getting Started

### 1. Take the Calibration Test

Start by running the calibration test to determine your skill level:

```bash
jupyter notebook 00_calibration_test.ipynb
```

The test covers:
- Basic syntax and variables
- Control flow and functions
- Data structures
- Object-oriented programming
- Advanced concepts (decorators, generators, algorithms)

Based on your score, you'll be recommended one of three levels:
- **0-30 points**: Easy Level
- **31-60 points**: Medium Level
- **61+ points**: Hard Level

### 2. Choose Your Path
