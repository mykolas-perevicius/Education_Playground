# Education Playground - Interactive Python Learning Platform

Welcome to the Education Playground! This is a comprehensive, self-paced Python programming course designed for learners of all levels.

## Overview

This repository contains a complete Python curriculum organized into three difficulty levels, each with hands-on Jupyter notebook lessons. Whether you're a complete beginner or looking to master advanced concepts, there's a path for you!

## Getting Started

### 1. Take the Calibration Test

Start by running the calibration test to determine your skill level:

```bash
jupyter notebook 00_calibration_test.ipynb
```

The test covers:
- Basic syntax and variables
- Control flow and functions
- Data structures
- Object-oriented programming
- Advanced concepts (decorators, generators, algorithms)

Based on your score, you'll be recommended one of three levels:
- **0-30 points**: Easy Level
- **31-60 points**: Medium Level
- **61+ points**: Hard Level

### 2. Choose Your Path

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Education_Playground.git
cd Education_Playground
```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install Jupyter:
```bash
pip install jupyter
```

4. Start Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## How to Use This Course

1. **Start with the calibration test** to find your level
2. **Work through notebooks sequentially** within your level
3. **Complete all exercises** in each notebook
4. **Practice regularly** - coding is a skill that improves with practice
5. **Don't rush** - take your time to understand each concept
6. **Experiment** - modify the code examples and see what happens
7. **Move to the next level** when you feel comfortable

## Features

- **Self-paced learning**: Go at your own speed
- **Interactive exercises**: Learn by doing
- **Real code examples**: See concepts in action
- **Progressive difficulty**: Build skills systematically
- **Comprehensive coverage**: From basics to advanced topics

## Learning Tips

- **Run every code cell**: Don't just read - execute and experiment!
- **Modify examples**: Change values and see what happens
- **Complete exercises**: They reinforce what you've learned
- **Take breaks**: Your brain needs time to process new information
- **Review previous lessons**: Repetition strengthens understanding
- **Build projects**: Apply what you've learned to real problems
